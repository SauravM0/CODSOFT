ðŸš€ The latest project, which I worked on during my AI internship, is incredibly cool! ðŸš€

Python has been used by me to make a rule-based chatbot that is easy to make. It will always learn and improve itself with time, despite being able to perform simple greetings.
ðŸ’¡ I canâ€™t wait to get more into artificial intelligence and machine learning because of the limitless opportunities in this sphere.


In Python, I made a Tic Tac Toe game thatâ€™s both basic and straightforward. It facilitated my comprehension of the gaming system as well as how users interface with it and simple AI ideas.
ðŸ’¡No doubt, such practical experience is very important for me in future as I keep exploring the amazing world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.


In order to process the data, implement algorithms and interact with users, I developed a recommendation system in python. 
This project enlightened me about customerâ€™s tastes and enable me give them personalized suggestions.
